```bash
ssh -qTfnN -D 8080 username@yourhost.com
alias sshtunnel="ssh -qTfnN -D 8080 username@yourhost.com"
```

The options are as follows:

* -q : be very quite, we are acting only as a tunnel.
* -T : Do not allocate a pseudo tty, we are only acting a tunnel.
* -f : move the ssh process to background, as we don&rsquo;t want to interact with this ssh session directly.
* -N : Do not execute remote command.
* -n : redirect standard input to /dev/null.
